However, this provision does not exempt these organizations from the purview of the\\nAct in respect of the information pertaining to the allegations of corruption and human rights\\nviolations. Thus, the citizens have a right, though limited, to seek information from these\\norganizations. Therefore, it is necessary that these organizations too designate Central Public\\nInformation Officers to deal with the RTI applications.\\n2. The Act does not contain any special provision about the method of supply of information\\nin respect of allegations of corruption by the above referred organizations.

The Second Administrative Reforms Commission in its First Report\\n(June 2006) has observed that where a public authority designates more than\\none Public Information Officer (NO), an applicant is likely to face difficulty in\\napproaching the appropriate Public Information Officer, and the applicants\\nwould also face problem in identifying the officer senior in rank to the PlO to\\nwhom an appeal under sub-section (1) of Section 19 of the Act can be marie.\\n(For convenience such an officer is termed as the First Appellate Authority).\\nThe Commission has, inter-a[ia, recommended that all Ministries!\\nDepartments/Agencies/Offices, with more than one P10, should designate a\\nNodal O±icer with the authority to receive requests for information on behalf of\\nall PIOs. The Commission has also recommended that all the public authorities\\nshould designate the First Appellate Authorities.\\n2. It is, therefore, requested that all public authorities with more than one\\nPlO should create a central point within the organisation where all the RTI\\napplications and the appeals ad&essed to the First Appellate Authorities may be\\nreceived. An officer should be made responsible to ensure that all the RTT\\napplications/appeals received at the central point are sent to the concerned\\nPublic Information Officers/Appellate Authorities, on the same day. For\\ninstance, the RTI applications/appeals may be received in the Receipt and Issue\\nSection! Central Registry Section of the Ministry/Department\\n/OrgansiationiAgeney and distributed to the concerned PIOs/Appellate\\nAuthorities. The R&I/CR Section may maintain a separate register for the\\npurpose.

Sub-section (8) of Section 7 of the RTI Act provides that where a request\\nfor information is rejected, the Public Information Officer shall, inter-alia,\\ncommunicate to the person making the request the particulars of the Appellate\\nAuthority. Thus, the applicant is informed about the particulars of the Appellate\\nAuthority when a request for information is rejected. There may be cases where\\nthe Public Information Officer does not reject the application, but the applicant\\ndoes not receive a decision within the time as specified in the Act or he is\\naggrieved by the decision of the Public Information Officer. In such cases the\\napplicant may like to exercise his right to appeal. But in absence of the\\nparticulars of the appellate authority, the applicant may face difficulty in\\nmaking an appeal. It has, therefore, been decided that all the public authorities\\nshall designate the First Appellate Authorities and publish their particulars\\nalongwith the particulars of the PIOs.\\n4.

Section 6(1) of the Act enables the Government to prescribe application fee\\nand sub-sections (1) and (5) of Section 7 to prescribe fee in addition to application\\nfee for supply of information. On the other hand sub-section (3) of Section 7\\nprovides the procedure which a PlO has to follow for realizing the fee prescribed\\nunder sub-sections (1) and (5) of the Section Details of fees that can be charged by\\na public authority under the Central Government are contained in the Right to\\nh,forrnation (Regulation of Fee & Cost) Rules, 2005. The Rules or the Act do not\\ngive power to the PlO to charge any fee other than prescribed in the Fee and Cost\\nRules. Attention in this regard is invited to following extracts from the common order\\npassed by the Central Information Commission in Appeal No. CICIMNAJ200B/0185\\n(Shri K.K. Kishore Vs. Institute of Company Secretaries of India) and Complaint\\nNo.ClCtWBlCl2007/00943 (Shri Subodh Jam Vs. Dy. Commissioner of Police):\\n\"The Act under proviso to sub-section (5) of Section 7 also provides that fee\\nprescribed under sub-sections (1) and (5) of Section 7 shall be reasonable\\nand no such fee shall be charged from the persons who are below poverty\\nline as may be determined by the Appropriate Government. The\\nGovernment has already prescribed fees as deemed reasonable mandated\\nunder Sections 7(1) and 7(5) of the Act and in the view of the Commission,\\nthere is no provision for any further fee apart from the one already prescribed\\nunder Sections 7(1) and 7(5) of the Act\".\\nxxx23/191\\n11/13/202 i-IR-1\\n2522461/2023/IR-1\\n0 -:2:-\\n\"Thus, there is provision for charging of fee only under Section 6(1) which is\\nthe application fee; Section 7(1) which is the fee charged for photocopying\\netc. and Section 7 (5) which is for getting information in printed or electronic\\nformat. But there is no provision for any further fee and if any further fee is\\nbeing charged by the Public Authorities in addition to what is already\\nprescribed under Section 6(1), 7(1) and 7(5) of the Act, the same would be in\\ncontravention of the Right to Information Act. The further fee\\' mentioned in\\nSection 7(3) only refers to the procedure in availing of the further fee already\\nprescribed under 7(5) of the RTI Act, which is \"further\" in terms of the basic\\nfee of Rs.1O/- . Section 7(3), therefore, provides for procedure for realizing\\nthe fees so prescribed\".\\n3. The Commission, while delivering decision in above cases, recommended to\\nthis Department to make rules, for charging fee towards supply of information which\\nmay include fee for supply of books, maps, plans, documents, samples, models etc.\\nthat are priced and towards postallcourier charges for mailing information, when\\npostal/courier charges are in excess of minimum slab prescribed by the Department\\nof Posts arid for other similar situations.\\n4. The Right to Information (Regulation of Fee & Cost) Rules, 2005 already\\nprovide provisions for chargtng of fee for giving information in diskettes or floppies or\\nin the form of photo copy; for providing samples, models, printed material like books,\\nmaps, plans etc; and for inspection of records. The Government have, however, not\\nconsidered it desirable to charge fee towards expenditure involved in mailing\\ninformation or overhead expenditure etc. Nevertheless, supply of information in a\\nform which would disproportionately divert the resources of the public authority is\\ntaken care of by Section 7(9) of the Act according to which information shall\\nordinarily be provided in the form in which it is sought but supply of information in a\\nparticular form may be refused if supply of information in that form would divert the\\nresources of the public authority disproportionately.\\n5. Ills hereby clarified that where a Public Information Officer takes a decision to\\nprovide information on payment of fee in addition to the application fee, he should\\ndetermine the quantum of such fee in accordance with the fee prescribed under the\\nFee arid Cost Rules referred to above and give the details of such fee to The\\napplicant together with the calculation made to arrive at such fee. Since the Act or\\nthe Rules do not provide for charging of fee towards postal expenses or cost involved\\nin deployment of man power for supply of information etc., he should not ask the\\napplicant to pay fee on such account. However, wherever supply of information in a\\nparticular form would disproportionately divert the resources of the public authority or\\nwould be detrimental to the safety or preservation of the records, the PlO may refuse\\nto supply the information in that form.24/191\\n11 / 1 3 / 2021-I R- I\\n2522461/2023 /IR-1\\n-:3 :-\\n6.

According to sub-section (3) of section 6 of the RTI Act, if\\nan application is received by a public authority seeking an information which is held\\nby another public authority or which is more closely connected with the subject\\nmatter relating to another public authority, the public authority receiving the\\napplication should transfer the application to the concerned public authority. It may\\nbe pointed out here that the Prime Minister\\'s Office has been assigned the work of\\nproviding secretariat assistance to the Prime Minister. After a decision is taken in a\\nmatter, the Ministry/Department to which the matter concerns takes further action\\nregarding issue of orders etc. Naturally, the information in such cases would be\\navailable with the concerned Ministry/Department and not the PMO. The CPIO\\nreceiving the application should carefully see the subject matter in the RTI\\napplication and transfer it, if need be, to the concerned public authority and not to\\nthe PMO simply because the applicant has made a reference to the PM or PMO.\\n2.

Some times, such an information is\\nsought, a part or no part of which is available with the public authority to which the\\napplication is made and remaining or whole of the information concerns another\\npublic authority or many other public authorities. A question has arisen as to how to\\ndral with such cases.\\n2. \\'Section 6(1) of the RTI Act, 2005 provides that a person who desires to obtain\\nany in formation shall make a request to the public information officer (PlO) of the\\nconcerned public authority. Section 6(3) provides that where an application is made\\nto a public authority requesting for any information which is held by another public\\nauthority or the subject matter of which is more closely connected with the functions\\nof another public authority, the public authority to which such application is made,\\nshall transfer the application to that other public authority. A careful reading of the\\nprovisions of sub-section (1) and sub-section(3) of Section 6, suggests that the Act\\nrequires an information seeker to address the application to the PlO of the\\n\\'concerned public authority\\'. However, there may be cases in which a person of\\no\\' dinary prudence may believe that the piece of information sought by him/her would\\nt,e available with the public authority to which he/she has addressed the application,\\n\\'out is actually held by some another public authority. In such cases, the applicant\\nmakes a bonafide mistake of addressing the application to the PlO of a wrong public\\nauthority. On the other hand where an applicant addresses the application to the\\nPlO of a public authority, which to a person of ordinary prudence, would not appear\\nto be the concern of that public authority, the applicant does not fulfill his\\nresponsibility of addressing the application to the \\'concerned public authority\\'.\\n.2/-69/19 1\\n11/13/2021-I R-I\\n2522461/2023/lR-1\\n-:2:-\\n3. Given hereinunder are some situations which may arise in the matter and action\\nreqwred to be taken by the public authorities in such cases:\\n(I) A person makes an application to a public authority for some information\\nwhich concerns some another public authority. In such a case, the PlO\\nreceiving the application should transfer the application to the concerned\\npublic authority under intimation to the applicant. However, if the PlO of the\\npublic authority is not able to find out as to which public authority is concerned\\nwith the information even after making reasonable efforts to find out the\\nconcerned public authority, he should inform the applicant that the information\\nis not available with that public authority and that he is not aware of the\\nparticulars of the concerned public authority to which the application could be\\ntransferred. It would, however, be the responsibility of the PlO, if an appeal is\\nmade against his decision, to establish that he made reasonable efforts to\\nfind out the particulars of the concerned public authority.\\n(ii) A person makes an application to a public authority for information, only a\\npart of which is available with that public authority and a part of the\\ninformation concerns some \\'another public authority.\\' In such a case, the PlO\\nshould supply the information available with him and a copy of the application\\nshould be sent to that another public authority under intimation to the\\napplicant.\\n(iii) A person makes an application to a public authority for information, a part of\\nwhich is available with that public authority and the rest of the information is\\nscattered with more than one other public authorities. In such a case, the PlO\\nof the public authority receiving the application should give information\\nrelating to it and advise the applicant to make separate applications to the\\nconcerned public authorities for obtaining information from them. If no part of\\nthe information sought, is available with it but is scattered with more than one\\nother public authorities, the PlO should inform the applicant that information is\\nnot available with the public authority and that the applicant should make\\nseparate applications to the concerned public authorities for obtaining\\ninformation from them. It may be noted that the Act requires the supply of\\nsuch information only which already exists and is held by the public authority\\nor held under the control of the public authority. It is beyond the scope of the\\nAct for a public authority to create information. Collection of information, parts\\nof which are available with different public authorities, would amount to\\ncreation of information which a public authority under the Act is not required\\nto do. At the same time, since the information is not related to any one\\nparticular public authority, it Is not the case where application should be\\ntransferred under sub-section (3) of Section 6 of the Act. It is pertinent to\\nnote that sub-section (3) refers to \\'another public authority\\' and not \\'other\\npublic authorities\\'. Use of singular form in the Act in this regard Is important\\nto note.\\n.3/-70/191\\n11/13/ 202 1-IR-I\\n2522461 / 2023,\\'i R- I\\n-:3\\n(iv) If a person makes an application to a public authority for some information\\nwhich is the concern of a public authority under any State Government or\\nthe Union Territory Administration, the Central Public Information Officer\\n(CPIO) of the public authority receiving the application should inform the\\napplicant that the information may be had from the concerned State\\nGovernrrentfUT Administration. Application, in such a case, need not be\\ntransferred to the State Government/UT Administration\\n4. Contents of this OM may be brought to the notice of all concerned.\\n(K.G V\\nDirector\\n1.

Further, it requires the Government to update the guide at\\nregular intervals. Accordingly a Guide on the Act was published online on\\n28.11.2013 to help all the stake-holders viz, information seekers in getting\\ninformation, public information officers in dealing with the RTI applications, first\\nappellate authorities in taking cogent decisions on appeals and the public\\nauthorities in implementing various provisions of the Act in right earnest.\\n2. The Public Information Officers/First Appellate Authorities should keep in\\nmind the salient features of the guidelines in supply of information to the\\ninformation seeker and disposal of first appeal respectively, so that information\\nseekers may not resort to filing of second appeals before the Information\\nCommissions. The relevant salient features of the guidelines are reiterated\\nbelow for consideration of the Public Information Officers and First Appellate\\nAuthorities:\\nSupply of Information by the Public Information Officer\\n1) The answering Public Information Officer should check whether the\\ninformation sought or a part thereof is exempt from disclosure under\\nSection 8 or Section 9 of the Act. Request in respect of the part of\\n194/19 1\\n11/13/ 202 1-IR-I\\n2522461/Z0a3/IR-I\\nthe application which is so exempt may be rejected and rest of the\\ninformation should be provided immediately or after receipt of\\nadditional fees, as the case may be.\\n2) Where a request for information is rejected. the Public Information\\nOfficer should communicate to the person making the request—\\n(i) the reasons for such rejection;\\n(ii) the period within which an appeal against such rejection\\nmay be preferred; and\\n(iii) the particulars of the authority to whom an appeal can be\\nmade.\\n3) If additional fee is required to be paid by the applicant as provided\\nin the Fee and Cost Rules, the Public Information Officer should\\ninform the applicant:\\n(i) the details of further fees required to be paid;\\n(ii) the calculations made to arrive at the amount of fees asked\\nfor;\\n(iii) the fact that the applicant has a right to make appeal about\\nthe amount of fees so demanded;\\n(iv) the particulars of the authority to whom such an appeal can\\nbe made; and\\n(v) the time limit within which the appeal can be made.\\n4) Though there is no hard and fast rule as to when exactly intimation\\nabout additional fees is to be given to the applicant, such\\nintimation should be given soon after receipt of Rh application.\\nDisposal of Appeal by the First Appellate Authority\\n1) While disposing off first appeals, the first Appellate Authorities should\\nact in a fair and judicious manner. It is very important that the order\\npassed by the first appellate authority should be a detailed and\\nspeaking order, giving justification for the decision arrived at.\\n2) If an appellate authority while deciding an appeal comes to a\\nconclusion that the appellant should be supplied information in\\n295/191\\n11/13/2021-IR-I\\n2522461/2023/IR-I\\naddition to what has been supplied by the Public Information\\nOfficer, he may either (1) pass an order direcflng the Public\\nInformation Officer to give such informaf ion to the appellant; or (ii)\\nhe himself may give information to the appellant. In the first case\\nthe appellate authority should ensure that the information ordered\\nby him to be supplied is supplied to the appellant immediately. It\\nwould, however, be better if the appellate authority chooses the\\nsecond course of actiOn and he himself furnishes the information\\nalongwith the order passed by him in the matter.\\n(Sandeep Jam)\\nDirector\\nTel: 23092755\\n1.

Section 19(6) of the RTI Act provides that the first Appellate Authority\\nshould dispose off the appeal within thirty days of the receipt of the appeal. In\\nexceptional cases, the appellate authority may take forty five days to dispose off\\nthe appeal subject to the condition that he shall record in writing the reasons for\\ndelay in deciding the appeal. Therefore, each first appellate authority should\\nensure that an appeal received by him is disposed off within 30 days of the receipt\\nof the appeal. If, in some exceptional cases, it is not possible to dispose off the\\nappeal within 30 days, its disposal should not take more than 45 days. In such\\ncases, the appellate authority should record, in writing, the reasons for not deciding\\nthe appeal within 30 days.\\n3. Deciding appeals under the RTL Act is a quasi-judicial function. It is,\\ntherefore, necessary that the appellate authority should see to it that the justice is\\nnot only done but it should also appear to have been done. In order to do so, the\\norder passed by the appellate authority should be a speaking order giving\\njustification for the decision arrived at.102/191\\n11/ 13/2021-IR-I\\n252 2461/2023/IR-I\\n4. It\\' an appellate authori.y comes to a conclusion that the appellant should be\\nsupplied information in addition to what has been supplied to him by the CPIO. he\\nmay either (I) pass an order directing the CPIO to give such information to the\\nappellant; or (ii) he himself may give information to the appellant while disposing\\noff the appeal. In the first case the appellate authority should ensure that the\\ninformation ordered by him to be supplied is supplied to the appellant immediately.\\nIt would, however, be better if the appellate authority chooses the second course of\\naction and he himself furnishes the information alongwith the order passed by him\\nin the matter.\\n5. The Central In formation Commission has also pointed out that some of the\\nMinistries/Departments have appointed very junior officers as appellate authorities\\nwho are not in a position to enforce their orders. The Act provides that the first\\nappellate authority would be an officer senior in rank to the CPIO. Thus, the\\nappellate authority, as per provisions of the Act, would be an officer in a\\ncommanding position vis-à-vis the CPIO. Nevertheless, if, in any case, the CPIO\\ndoes not implement the order passed by the appellate authority and the appellate\\nauthority feels that intervention of higher authority is required to get his order\\nimplemented, he should bring the matter to the notice of the officer in the public\\nauthority competent to take against the CPIO. Such competent officer shall take\\nnecessary action so as to ensure implementation of the provisions of the RTI Act.\\n6. Contents of this OM may be brought to the notice of all concej\\n(KG.

Section 4(2) and Section 4(3)\\nprescribe the method of dissemination of this information. The purpose of suo motu\\ndisclosures under Section 4 is to place large amount of information in public domain on a\\nproactive basis to make the functioning of the Public Authorities more transparent and also\\nto reduce the need for filing individual RTI applications.\\n2. Since the promulgation of the Act in 2005, large amount of information relating to\\nfunctioning of the government is being put in public domain. However, the quality and\\nquantity of proactive disclosure is not up to the desired level. It was felt that the weak\\nimplementation of the Section 4 of the RTl Act is partly due to the fact that certain\\nprovisions of this Section have not been fully detailed and, in case of certain other\\nprovisions there is need for laying down detailed guidelines. Further there is need to set up\\na compliance mechanism to ensure that requirements under section 4 of the RTl Act are\\nmet.\\n3. In order to address the above, Government of India constituted a Task Force on suo\\nmotu disclosure under the RTI Act, 2005 in May 2011 which included representatives of civil\\nsociety organizations active in the field of Right to Information, for strengthening\\ncompliance with provisions for suo mow or proactive disclosure as given in Section 4 of the\\nRTI Act, 2005. Based on the report of the Task Force, the Government have decided to issue\\nguidelines for suo motu disclosure under section 4 of the RTl Act.11/13/ 202 1-IR-I\\n2522461/2023/IR-I\\n4. Guidelines for Central Government Ministries/Departments are on:\\ni. Suo motu disclosure of more items under Section 4.\\nu.

However, it may be kept in mind that proactive\\ndisclosure should be done in the local language so that it remains accessible to public. It\\nshould be presented in a form that is easily understcod and if technical words are used they\\nshould be carefully explained. As provided in section 4, disclosure should be made in as\\nmany mediums as feasible and disclosures should be kept up to date. The disclosure of\\nInformation may be made keeping in mind the provisions of Section 8 to 11 of the RTI Act.\\n6.

All transfer orders should be publicized through the website\\nor in any other manner listed in Section 4(4) of the Act. These guidelines would not be\\napplicable in cases of transfers made keeping in view sovereignty, integrity, security,\\nstrategic, scientific or economic interests of the State and the exemptions covered under\\nSection 8 of the Act. These instructions would not apply to security and intelligence\\norganizations under the second schedule of the RTI Act.\\n1.4 RTI Applications\\n1.4.1 All Public Authorities shall proactively disclose RTI applications and appeals received\\nand their responses, on the websites maintained by Public Authorities with search facility\\nbased on key words.

Information to be disclosed proactively may contain nature of the official tour,\\nplaces visited, the period, number of people included in the official delegation and total cost\\nof such travel undertaken. Exemptions under Section 8 of the RTI Act, 2005 may be kept in\\nview while disclosing the information. These instructions would not apply to security and\\nintelligence organisations under the second schedule of the RTI Act, 2005 and CVOs of\\npublic authorities.116/191\\n11/13/ 202 i-IR-1\\n2522461 / 2023 / I R- I\\nA\\n2.0 Guidelines for digital publication of proactive disclosure under Section 4\\n2.1 Section 4 lays down that information should be provided through many mediums\\ndepending upon the level of the public authority and the recipient of information (for\\nexample, in case of Panchayat, wall painting may be more effective means of dissemination\\nof information), and that more and more proactive disclosure would gradually be made\\nthrough Internet. There is need for more clear guidelines for web-based publication of\\ninformation for disclosure.\\n2.2 The Department of Information Technology has been working on setting of technical\\nstandards for government websites and the Department of Administrative Reforms & Public\\nGrievances has published guidelines for websites of Government Departments. These\\nguidelines prescribe the manner in which websites need to be designed and how\\ninformation should be disclosed. While adhering to the standards of government guidelines\\nas laid down by Department of Information Technology and Department of Administrative\\nReforms & Public Grievances, the following principles additionally should also be kept in\\nview to ensure that websites\\' disclosures are complete, easily accessible, technology and\\nplatform neutral and in a form which conveys the desired information in an effective and\\nuser-friendly manner.\\na) It should be the endeavor of all public authorities that all entitlements to citizens and\\nall transactions between the citizen and government are gradually made available\\nthrough computer based interface. The \\'Electronic Delivery of Services Bill, 2012\\'\\nunder formulation in Government of India would provide the necessary impetus.\\nb) Websites should contain detailed information from the point of origin to the point of\\ndelivery of entitlements/services provided by the Public Authorities to citizens.\\nc) Orders of the public authority should be uploaded on the website immediately after\\nthey have been issued.\\nd) Website should contain all the relevant Acts, Rules, forms and other documents\\nwhich are normally accessed by citizens.117/191\\n11/13/2021-IR-I\\n2522461/2023/JR-I\\ne) Websites should have detaed directory of key contacts, details of officials of the\\nPublic Authority.\\nf) It is obligatory under Section 4(1)(b)(xiv) of the RTI Act for every Public Authority to\\nproactively disclose \\'details in respect of the information, available to or held by it,\\nreduced in an electronic form\\'. The website should therefore indicate which digitally\\nheld information is made available publicly over the internet and which is not.\\ng) As departments reorganize their systems and processes to enable themselves for\\nelectronic service delivery, it is recommended that the requirement of bringing due\\ntransparency as provided in the RTI Act is given adequate consideration at the design\\nstage itself.\\nh) To maintain reliability of information and its real time updation, information\\ngeneration in a digital form should be automatically updated on the basis of key\\nwork outputs, like a muster roll and salary slip (NREGA in Andhra Pradesh) or\\nformalization of a government order (Andhra Pradesh). Such an approach will lead to\\nautomation of proactive disclosure.\\ni) Information must be presented from a user\\'s perspective, which may require re-\\narranging it, simplifying it etc. However, original documents in original formats\\nshould continue to be made available because these are needed for community\\nmonitoring of government\\'s functioning.\\nj) The \\'National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy by the Department of Science\\nand Technology is based on the principle that all publicly funded information should\\nbe readily available. The policy has been notified in March, 2012 and the schedule\\nshould be strictly adhered to.\\nk) Information and data should be presented in open data formats whereby it can be\\npulled by different Application Protocol Interfaces to be used in different fashions\\nmore appropriate to specific contexts and needs. lnformation/ data can, for\\ninstance, be presented in powerful visual ways using visualisation techniques. Such\\nvisual representation of information/ data can give insights that may remain largely\\n5118/19 1\\n11/13/ 202 1-IR-I\\n2522461/2023/IR-1\\nhidden in a textual or tabular presentation of data. In some contexts, pictures and\\naudio/videos recordings etc may be more useful. There have been moves in some\\nparts of the country to video record Gram Sabha meetings. A picture of a NREGA\\nworksite, for instance, may tell much more than words can. All such different media\\nand forms should be used for proactive disclosure.\\nI) Every webpage displaying information or data proactively disclosed under the RTI\\nAct should, on the top right corner, display the mandatory field \\'Date last updated\\n(DD/MM/YY)\\'.119/19 1\\n11/13/2021-IR-1\\n2522461/2023/lR-1\\n3.0 Guidelines for certain clauses of Section 4(1)(b) to make disclosure more effective\\nU\\n3.1 The elements of information listed in the variou5 sub-clauses of Section 4(1)(b) must\\nbe disclosed in an integrated manner. For example, the functions and responsibilities of a\\npublic authority cannot be understood in isolation from the powers and functions of its\\nemployees, the norms that inform its decision making processes and the rules, instructions\\nand manuals that are used in the discharge of its functions. Description of one element\\npresupposes the existence of another. So every public authority must endeavour to\\nintegrate the information mentioned in these sub-clauses while preparing voluntary\\ndisclosure materials.\\n3.2 Considering that disclosure in regard to certain sub-clauses have been relatively\\nweak, detailed guidelines for four sub-clauses are given below:\\n3.3 Guidelines for section 4(1)(b)(iii) - \"the procedure followed in the decision-making\\nprocesses, including channels of supervision and accountability\".\\n3.3.1 All government departments have specific duties and responsibilities under the\\nrespective Allocation of Business Rules (AOB) issued by the appropriate Government. The\\nconstitutional provisions and statutes each department is required to implement are clearly\\nlaid down in the AOB. The manner of disposal of matters assigned to each\\nDepartment/Ministry is described in the Transaction of Business Rules (TOB). Additionally,\\nevery department would have a specific set of schemes and development programmes\\nwhich they are required to implement directly or through their subordinate offices or other\\ndesignated agencies. These documents contain the specific operations that every Public\\nAuthority is required to undertake in the course of implementing the programme or\\nscheme. Every operation mandated under the AOB read with the TOB would be linked to a\\nspecific decision-making chain. All government officers have to follow laid down office\\nprocedure manual or the other rules which gives details of how representations, petitions\\nand applications from citizens must be dealt with. Templates, formats, and basic steps of\\ndecision-making are briefly explained in such manuals. These descriptions constitute the\\nelements of decision-making processes in general.120/191\\n11/13/ 202 1-IR-1\\n2522461/2023/lR-1\\n3.3.2 Additionally, in the routine work of governance, government functionaries are\\n0(cid:9) required to make decisions in a discretionary manner but broad guiding principles are laid\\ndown in some rule or the other. For example, the General Financial Rules lay down\\nprocedures for a variety of operations relating to government finances. How sanction must\\nbe accorded for incurring expenditure; how losses to government must be reported; how\\nresponsibility for losses may be fixed on any government servant; how budgets, demand for\\ngrants are prepared and submitted; how public works must be sanctioned and executed;\\nhow commodities and services may be procured by a public authority; are all explained in\\nthese manuals which are updated from time to time. The challenge is to present a simplified\\nversion of the decision-making procedure that is of interest to a common citizen.\\n3.3.3 In view of the above, the guidelines for detailing the decision making processes are\\nas follows:\\n(a) Every public authority should specifically identify the major outputs! tangible\\nresults! services! goods, as applicable, that it is responsible for providing to the\\npublic or to whosoever is the client of the public authority.\\n(b) In respect of (a) above, the decision-making chain should be identified in the form of\\na flow chart explaining the rank/grade of the public functionaries involved in the\\ndecision-making process and the specific stages in the decision-making hierarchy.\\n(c) The powers of each officer including powers of supervision over subordinates\\ninvolved in the chain of decision-making must also be spelt out next to the flow chart\\nor in a simple bullet-pointed format in a text-box. The exceptional circumstances\\nwhen such standard decision-making processes may be overridden and by whom,\\nshould also be explained clearly. Where decentralization of decision-making has\\noccurred in order to grant greater autonomy to public authorities, such procedures\\nmust also be clearly explained.\\n(d) This design of presentation should then be extended to cover all statutory and\\ndiscretionary operations that are part of the public authority\\'s mandate under the\\nAOB read with the TOB.121/191\\n11/13/ 202 1-IR-1\\n2522461/2023/IR-I\\n(e) In the event of a public authority altering an existing decision-making process or\\nadopting an entirely new process, such changes must be explained in simple\\nlanguage in order to enable people to easily understand the changes made.\\n3.4 Guidelines for Section 4(1)(b)(iv) - \"the norms set by it for the discharge of its\\nfunctions\".\\n3.4.1 Primarily, the intention of this clause is that every public authority should proactively\\ndisclose the standards by which its performance should be judged. Norms may be\\nqualitative or quantitative in nature, or temporal or statutory norms. In order to ensure\\ncompliance with this clause, public authorities would need to disclose norms for major\\nfunctions that are being performed.\\n3.4.2 Citizen Charters, which are mandatory, for each central\\nMinistry/Department/Authority, are good examples of vehicles created for laying down\\nnorms of performance for major functions and for monitoring achievements against those\\nstandards.\\n3.4.3 Wherever norms have been specified for the discharge of its functions by any statute\\nor government orders, they should be proactively disclosed, particularly linking them with\\nthe decision making processes as detailed earlier. All Public Authorities should proactively\\ndisclose the following:\\na) Defining the services and goods that the particular public authority/office\\nprovides directly (or indirectly through any other agency/contractor).\\nb) Detailing and describing the processes by which the public can access and/or\\nreceive the goods and services that they are entitled to, from the public\\nauthority/office along with the forms, if any prescribed, for use by both the\\napplicant and the service providing agency. Links to such forms (online),\\nwherever available, should be given.\\nc) Describing the conditions, criteria and priorities under which a person becomes\\neligible for the goods and services, and consequently the categories of people\\nwho are entitled to receive the goods and services.122/191\\n11/13/ 202 1-lR-I\\n2522461/2023/IR-1\\nd) Defining the quantitative and tangible parameters, (weight, size, frequency etc,)\\nand timelines, that are applicable to the goods and services that are accessible to\\nthe public.\\ne) Defining the qualitative and quantitative outcomes that each public\\nauthority/office plans to achieve through the goods and services that it was\\nobligated to provide.\\nf) Laying down individual responsibility for providing the goods and services (who is\\nresponsible for delivery/implementation and who is responsible for supervision).\\n3.5 Guidelines for Section 4(1)(b)(xi)- \"the budget allocated to each of its agency,\\nindicating the particulars of all plans, proposed expenditures and reports on\\ndisbursements made\".\\n3.5.1 The public authorities while disclosing their budgets shall undertake the following:\\n(a) Keeping in view of the technical nature of the government budgets, it is essential\\nthat Ministries/Departments prepare simplified versions of their budgets which can\\nbe understood easily by general public and place them in public domain. Budgets\\nand their periodic monitoring reports may also be presented in a more user-friendly\\nmanner through graphs and tables, etc.\\n(b) Outcome budget being prepared by Ministries/Departments of Government of India\\nshould be prominently displayed and be used as a basis to identify physical targets\\nplanned during the budgetary period and the actual achievement vis-à-vis those\\ntargets. A monthly programme implementation calendar method of reporting being\\nfollowed in Karnataka is a useful model.\\n(c) Funds released to various autonomous organizations! statutory organizations/\\nattached offices! Public Sector Enterprises! Societies! NG0s/ Corporations etc.\\nshould be put on the website on a quarterly basis and budgets of such authorities\\nmay be made accessible through links from the website of the Ministry/Department.\\nIf a subsidiary does not have a website then the budgets and expenditure reports of\\n10123/19 1\\n11/13/2021-IR-I\\n2522461/2023/IR-1\\nsuch subsidiary authárity may be uploaded on the vjebsite of the principal Public\\nAuthority.\\n(d) Wherever required by law or executive instruction, sector specific allocations and\\nachievements of every department or public authority (where feasible) must be\\nhighlighted. For example, budget allocation and target focusing on gender, children,\\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and religious minorities should be specially\\nhighlighted. The sector-wise breakup of these targets and actual outcomes must be\\ngiven in simplified form to enable the vulnerable segments of society to better\\nunderstand the budgets of public authorities.\\n3.6 Guidelines for Section 4(1)(b)(xiv) — details in respect of information, available to\\nor held by it, reduced in an electronic form.\\n3.6.1 On the one hand, this clause serves as a means of proactively disclosing the progress\\nmade in computerizing information under Section 4(1)(a) of the RTI Act in a periodic\\nmanner. On the other, it provides people with clarity about the kinds of electronic\\ninformation that, although not held by the public authority, is available to them. For\\nexample the stocks of ration available with individual fair price shops may not be held by the\\nDistrict Civil Supplies office, but may be available at a subordinate formation.\\n3.6.2 Keeping in view the varied levels of computerization of records and documents in\\npublic authorities, data about records that have been digitized may be proactively disclosed\\non the respective websites, excluding those records /files /information that are exempted\\nunder Section 8. The data about digitized record may include the name of the record and\\nany categorization or indexing used; the subject matter and any other information that is\\nrequired to be compiled in relation to a file as prescribed by Manual of Office Procedure\\n(and to be prescribed by MOP for electronic records that is under finalization by DARPG),\\nthe division! section/ unit! office where the record is normally held; the person, with\\ndesignation, responsible for maintaining the record; and the life span of the record, as\\nprescribed in the relevant record retention schedule.\\n11124/191\\n11/13/2021-IR-1\\n252?461/2023/IR-1\\n4.0 Compliance with Provisions of suo motu (proactive) disclosure under the RTI Act\\n• 4.1 Each Ministry/Public Authority shall ensure that these guidelines are fully\\noperationalized within a period of 6 months from the date of their issue.\\n4.2 Proactive disclosure as per these guidelines would require collating a large quantum\\nof information and digitizing it. For this purpose, Ministries/Public Authorities may engage\\nconsultants or outsource such work to expeditiously comply with these guidelines. For this\\npurpose, the plan/non-plan funds of that department may be utilized.\\n4.3 The Action Taken Report on the compliance of these guidelines should be sent, along\\nwith the URL link, to the DoPT and Central Information Commission soon after the expiry of\\nthe initial period of 6 months.\\n4.4 Each Ministry! Public Authority should get its proactive disclosure package audited\\nby third party every year. The audit should cover compliance with the proactive disclosure\\nguidelines as well as adequacy of the items included in the package. The audit should\\nexamine whether there are any other types of information which could be proactively\\ndisclosed. Such audit should be done annually and should be communicated to the Central\\nInformation Commission annually through publication on their own websites. All Public\\nAuthorities should proactively disclose the names of the third party auditors on their\\nwebsite. For carrying out third party audit through outside consultants also,\\nMinistries/Public Authorities should utilize their plan/non-plan funds.\\n4.5 The Central Information Commission should examine the third-party audit reports\\nfor each Ministry/Public Authority and offer advice/recommendations to the concerned\\nMinistries/ Public Authorities.\\n4.6 Central Information Commission should carry out sample audit of few of the\\nMinistries/ Public Authorities each year with regard to adequacy of items included as well as\\ncomplianceof the Ministry/Public Authority with these guidelines.\\n4.7 Compliance with the proactive disclosure guidelines, its audit by third party and its\\ncommunication to the Central Information Commission should be included as RFD target.\\n12125/191\\n11/13/ 202 1-IR-1\\n2522461/2023/IR-1\\n5.0 Nodal Officer\\n5.1 Each Central Ministry/ Public Authority should appoint a senior officer not below the\\nrank of a Joint Secretary and not below rank of Additional HOD in case of attached offices\\nfor ensuring compliance with the proactive disclosure guidelines. The Nodal Officer would\\niork under the supervision of the Secretary of the Ministry/Department or the HOD of the\\nattached office, as the case may be. Nodal Officers of Ministry/Department and HOD\\nseparately should also ensure that the formations below the Ministry/Department/Attached\\nOffice also disclose the information as per the proactive disclosure guidelines.\\n6.0 Annual Reports to Parliament/Legislatures\\n6.1 Government has issued directions to all Ministries/Departments to include a chapter\\non RTl Act in their Annual Reports submitted to the Parliament. Details about compliance\\nwith proactive disclosure guidelines should mandatorily be included in the relevant chapter\\nin Annual Report of Ministry/Department.\\n13126/191\\n11/13/2021-IR-1\\n2522461 / 2 23 / I R- I\\nNo. 1/34/2013-IR 1\\nI\\nGovernment of India\\nMinistry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions\\nDepartment of Personnel and Training\\n1\\nNorth Block, New Delhi-i\\n29th\\nDated: June 2015\\nOffice Memorandum\\nSubject: Implementation of Suo Motu Disclosure under Section 4 of PT!

These instructions would not apply to security and\\nintelligence organisations under the second schedule of the RTI Act, 2005 and CVOs of\\npublic authorities.138/91\\n1 1/13/2021-IR-1 (7 )\\n2522461/2023/IR-I\\n2.0 Guidelines for digital publication of proactive disclosure under Section 4\\n2.1 Section 4 lays down that information should be provided through many mediums\\ndepending upon the level of the public authority and the recipient of information (for\\nexample, in case of Panchayat, wall painting may be more effective means of dissemination\\nof information), and that more and more proactive disclosure would gradually be made\\nthrough Internet. There is need for more clear guidelines for web-based publication of\\ninformation for disclosure.\\n2.2 The Department of Information Technology has been working on setting of technical\\nstandards for government websites and the Department of Administrative Reforms & Public\\nGrievances has published guidelines for websites of Government Departments. These\\nguidelines prescribe the manner in which websites need to be designed and how information\\nshould be disclosed. While adhering to the standards of government guidelines as laid down\\nby Department of Information Technology and Department of Administrative Reforms &\\nPublic Grievances, the following principles additionally should also be kept in view to ensure\\nthat websites\\' disclosures are complete, easily accessible, technology and platform neutral\\nand in a form which conveys the desired information in an effective and user-friendly\\nmanner.\\na) It should be the endeavor of all public authorities that all entitlements to citizens and\\nall transactions between the citizen and government are gradually made available\\nthrough computer based interface. The \\'Electronic Delivery of Services Bill, 2012\\'\\nunder formulation in Government of India would provide the necessary impetus.\\nb) Vebsites should contain detailed information from the point of origin to the point of\\ndelivery of entitlements/services provided by the Public Authorities to citizens.\\nc Orders of the public authority should be uploaded on the website immediately after\\nthey have been issued.\\nd) Website should contain all the relevant Acts, Rules, forms and other documents which\\nare normally accessed by citizens.139/19 1\\n11 / 1 3 / 2021-I R- I\\n2522461 / 2023 / I R- I\\ne) Websites should have detailed directory of key contacts, details of officials of the\\nPublic Authority.\\nf) It is obligatory under Section 4(l)(b)(xiv) of the RTI Act for every Public Authority\\nto proactively disclose \\'details in respect of the information, available to or held by it,\\nreduced in an electronic form\\'. The website should therefore indicate which digitally\\nheld information is made available publicly over the internet and which is not.\\ng) As departments reorganize their systems and processes to enable themselves for\\nelectronic service delivery, it is recommended that the requirement of bringing due\\ntransparency as provided in the Rh Act is given adequate consideration at the design\\nstage itself.\\nh) To maintain reliability of information and its real time updation, information\\ngeneration in a digital form should be automatically updated on the basis of key work\\noutputs, like a muster roll and salary slip (REGA in Andhra Pradesh) or\\nformalization of a government order (Andhra Pradesh). Such an approach will lead to\\nautomation of proactive disclosure.\\ni) Information must be presented from a user\\'s perspective, which may require re-\\narranging it, simplifying it etc. However, original documents in original formats\\nshould continue to be made available because these are needed for community\\nmonitoring of government\\'s functioning.\\nj) The \\'National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy\\' by the Department of Science\\nand Technology is based on the principle that all publicly funded information should\\nbe readily available. The policy has been notified in March, 2012 and the schedule\\nshould be strictly adhered to.\\nk) Information and data should be presented in open data formats whereby it can be\\npulled by different Application Protocol Interfaces to be used in different fashions\\nmore appropriate to specific contexts and needs. Information! data can, for instance,\\nbe presented in powerful visual ways using visualisation techniques. Such visual\\nrepresentation of information! data can give insights that may remain largely\\n9140/191\\n11/13/ 202 i-IR-I\\n(7\\n2522461 / 2023 / I R- I\\nhidden in a textual or tabular presentation of data. In some contexts, pictures and\\naudio/videos recordings etc may be more useful. There have been moves in some\\nparts of the country to video record Gram Sabha meetings. A picture of a NREGA\\nworksite, for instance, may tell much more than words can. All such different media\\nand forms should be used for proactive disclosure.\\nI) Every webpage displaying information or data proactively disclosed under the Rh\\nAct should, on the top right corner, display the mandatory field \\'Date last updated\\n(DD/MM/YY)\\'.1 141/191\\n11/13/2021-IR-I\\n2522461 / Zö2 3 / I R- I\\n3.0 Guidelines for certain clauses of Section 4(1)(b) to make disclosure more effective\\n3.1 The elements of information listed in the various sub-clauses of Section 4(1 )(b) must\\nbe disclosed in an integrated manner. For example, the functions and responsibilities of a\\npublic authority cannot be understood in isolation from the powers and functions of its\\nemployees, the norms that inform its decision making processes and the rules, instructions\\nand manuals that are used in the discharge of its functions. Description of one element\\npresupposes the existence of another. So every public authority must endeavour to integrate\\nthe information mentioned in these sub-clauses while preparing voluntary disclosure\\nmaterials.\\n3.2 Considering that disclosure in regard to certain sub-clauses have been relatively weak,\\ndetailed guidelines for four sub-clauses are given below:\\n33 Guidelines for section 4(1)(b)(iii) - \"the procedure followed in the decision-making\\nprocesses, including channels of supervision and accountability\".\\n3.3.1 All government departments have specific duties and responsibilities under the\\nrespective Allocation of Business Rules (AOB) issued by the appropriate Government. The\\nconstitutional provisions and statutes each department is required to implement are clearly\\nlaid down in the AOB. The manner of disposal of matters assigned to each\\nDepartment/Ministry is described in the Transaction of Business Rules (TOB). Additionally,\\nevery department would have a specific set of schemes and development programmes which\\nthey are required to implement directly or through their subordinate offices or other\\ndesignated agencies. These documents contain the specific operations that every Public\\nAuthority is required to undertake in the course of implementing the programme or scheme.\\nEvery operation mandated under the AOB read with the TOB would be linked to a specific\\ndecision-making chain. All government officers have to follow laid down office procedure\\nmanual or the other rules which gives details of how representations, petitions and\\napplications from citizens must be dealt with. Templates, formats, and basic steps of decision-\\nmaking are briefly explained in such manuals. These descriptions constitute the elements of\\ndecision-making processes in general.142/191\\n11/13/2021-IR-I\\n2522461/2023/IR-I\\n332 Additionally, in the routine work of governance, government functionaries are\\nrequired to make decisions in a discretionary manner but broad guiding principles are laid\\ndown in some rule or the other. For example, the General Financial Rules lay down\\nprocedures for a variety of operations relating to government finances. How sanction must be\\naccorded for incurring expenditure; how losses to government must be reported; how\\nresponsibility for losses may be fixed on any government servant; how budgets, demand for\\ngrants are prepared and submitted; how public works must be sanctioned and executed; how\\ncommodities and services may be procured by a public authority; are all explained in these\\nmanuals which are updated from time to time. The challenge is to present a simplified version\\nof the decision-making procedure that is of interest to a common citizen.\\n333 In view of the above, the guidelines for detailing the decision making processes are as\\nfollows:\\n(a) Every public authority should specifically identify the major outputs/ tangible results!\\nservices! goods, as applicable, that it is responsible for providing to the public or to\\nwhosoever is the client of the public authority.\\n(b) In respect of (a) above, the decision-making chain should be identified in the form of\\na flow chart explaining the rank/grade of the public ftinctionaries involved in the\\ndecision-making process and the specific stages in the decision-making hierarchy.\\n(c) The powers of each officer including powers of supervision over subordinates\\ninvolved in the chain of decision-making must also be spelt out next to the flow chart\\nor in a simple bullet-pointed format in a.text-box. The exceptional circumstances\\nwhen such standard decision-making processes may be overridden and by whom,\\nshould also be explained clearly. Where decentralization of decision-making has\\noccurred in order to grant greater autonomy to public authorities, such procedures\\nmust also be clearly explained.\\n(d) This design of presentation should then be extended to cover all statutory and\\ndiscretionary operations that are part of the public authority\\'s mandate under the AOB\\nread with the TOB.\\nIICl 143/19 1\\n11/13/2021-I R-I\\n2522461/2023/IR-I\\n(e) In the event of a public authority altering an existing decision-making process or\\nadopting an entirely new process, such changes must be explained in simple language\\nin order to enable people to easily understand the changes made.\\n3.4 Guidelines for Section 4(1)(b)(iv) - \"the norms set by it for the discharge of its\\nfunctions\".\\n3.4.1 Primarily, the intention of this clause is that every public authority should proactively\\ndisclose the standards by which its performance should be judged. Norms may be qualitative\\nor quantitative in nature, or temporal or statutory norms. In order to ensure compliance with\\nthis clause, public authorities would need to disclose norms for major functions that are being\\nperformed.\\n3.42 Citizen Charters, which are mandatory, for each central\\nMinistry/Department/Authority, are good examples of vehicles created for laying down\\nnorms of performance for major functions and for monitoring achievements against those\\nstandards.\\n3.43 Wherever norms have been specified for the discharge of its functions by any statute\\nor government orders, they should be proactively disclosed, particularly linking them with the\\ndecision making processes as detailed earlier. All Public Authorities should proactively\\ndisclose the following:\\na) Defining the services and goods that the particular public authority/office provides\\ndirectly (or indirectly through any other agency/contractor).\\nb) Detailing and describing the processes by which the public can access and/or\\nreceive the goods and services that they are entitled to, from the public\\nauthority/office along with the forms, if any prescribed, for use by both the\\napplicant and the service providing agency. Links to such forms (online),\\nwherever available, should be given.\\nc) Describing the conditions, criteria and priorities under which a person becomes\\neligible for the goods and services, and consequently the categories of people who\\nare entitled to receive the goods and services.144/19 1\\n11/13/2021-IR-I\\n2522463 / 2023 / I R-I\\nd) Defining the quantitative and tangible parameters, (weight, size, frequency etc,)\\nand timelines, that are applicable to the goods and services that are accessible to\\nthe public.\\ne) Defining the qualitative and quantitative outcomes that each public\\nauthority/office plans to achieve through the goods and services that it was\\nobligated to provide.\\nf Laying down individual responsibility for providing the goods and services (who\\nis responsible for delivery/implementation and who is responsible forsupervision).\\n33 Guidelines for Section 4(1)(b)(xi)- \"the budget allocated to each of its agency,\\nindicating the particulars of all plans, proposed expenditures and reports on\\ndisbursements made\".\\n35.1 The public authorities while disclosing their budgets shall undertake the following:\\n(a) Keeping in view of the technical nature of the government budgets, it is essential that\\nMinistries/Departments prepare simplified versions of their budgets which can be\\nunderstood easily by general public and place them in public domain. Budgets and\\ntheir periodic monitoring reports may also be presented in a more user-friendly\\nmanner through graphs and tables, etc.\\n(b) Outcome budget being prepared by Ministries/Departments of Government of India\\nshould be prominently displayed and be used as a basis to identi\\' physical targets\\nplanned during the budgetary period and the actual achievement vis-à-vis those\\ntargets. A monthly programme implementation calendar method of reporting being\\nfollowed in Karnataka is a useful model.\\n(c) Funds released to various autonomous organizations! statutory organizations/ attached\\noffices/ Public Sector Enterprises/ Societies/ NGOs/ Corporations etc. should be put\\non the website on a quarterly basis and budgets of such authorities may be made\\naccessible through links from the website of the Ministry/Department. If a subsidiary\\ndoes not have a website then the budgets and expenditure reports of\\n/37 0 145/191\\n(_) 0 11/13/2021-IR-I\\n2522461 / 2o2\\' I R- I\\nsuch subsidiary authority may be uploaded on the website of the principal Public\\nAuthority.\\n(d) Wherever required by law or executive instruction, sector specific allocations and\\nachievements of every department or public authority (where feasible) must be\\nhighlighted.

The matter\\nreardin disclosure of the ACRs under the Act has been examined in\\nconsultation with the Department of Legal Affairs.\\n2.

An ACR contains\\ninformation about the character, capability and other attributes of the official\\nreported upon, disclosure of which to any other person amounts to cause\\nunwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual. Besides, an ACR, as its\\nname suggests, is a confidential document. The Official Secrets Act, 1923 is\\nnot completely superseded by the Right to Information Act.. Sub-section (2)\\nof Section 8 of the 2005 Act gives a discretion to the public authority to\\ndisclose or not to disclose the ACRs of an officer to himse\\'f or to any other\\napplicant.\\n3. It is clear from the 2h0ve discussion that the public authority is not\\nunder obligation to disclose ACRs of any employee to the employee himself\\nor to any other person inasmuch as disclosure of ACRs is protected by clause\\n(j) of sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the Rfl Act, and an ACR is a\\nconfidential document, disclosure of which is protected by the Official\\nSecrets Act, 1923. However, the public authority has a discretion to disclose\\nthe Annual Confidential Reports of an employee to the employee himself or\\nto any other person, if the public authority is satisfied that the public interest\\nin disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests.

In the process, a public authority\\nmay send some confidential papers to another public authority. A question has\\narisen whether the recipient public authority cart disclose such confidential\\npapers under the Rh Act, 2005. If yes, what procedure is required to be\\nfollowed for doing so.\\n2. Section Ii of the Act provides the procedure of disclosure of \\'third\\nparty\\' information, According to it, if a Public Information Officer (PLO)\\nintends to disclose an information supplied by a third party which the third party\\nhas treated as confidential, the PlO, before taking a decision to disclose the\\ninformation shall invite the third party to make submission in the matter. The\\nthird party has a right to make an appeal to the Departmental Appellate\\nAuthority against the decision of the PlO aid if not satisfied with the decision\\nof the Departmental Appellate Authority, a second appeal to the concerned\\nInformation Commission. The PlO cannot disclose such information unless the\\nprocedure prescribed in section 11 is completed.\\n3. As defined in clause (n) of Section 2 of the Act, \\'third party\\' includes a\\npublic authority. Reading of the definition of the term, \\'third party\\' and Section\\n11 together makes it clear that if a public authority \\'X\\' receives some161/191\\n11/13/2021-1 R-1\\n25U461/2023/IR-I\\ninformation from another public authority Y\\' which that public authoi-iiv has\\ntreated as confidential, then X\\' cannot disclose the information without\\nconsulting Y, the third party in respect of the information and without\\nfollowing the procedure pkescribed in Section 11 of the Act. It is a statutory\\nrequirement, nori-coinpliance of which may make the P10 liable to action.\\n4. The Public Information Officers and the First Appellate Authorities\\nshould keep these provisions of the Act in view while taking decision1 about\\ndisclosure of third party information in general and disclosure of the third party\\nut formation, when third party is a public authority, in particular.\\n5.

We heard the submissions of both the respondent and the third party in\\nthe case.\\n3. In his RTI application, the Appellant had sought the copies of the\\ncomplaints made against the third party in the case and the details of the action\\ntaken including the copies of the enquiry reports. He had also wanted the\\ncopies of the correspondence made between the Cabinet Secretariat and the\\nMinistry of Shipping in respect of the third party in the case. The CPIO after\\nconsuFting the third party under Section 11 of the Right to Information Act, had\\nCIC/SM/N20 13/000053164/191\\n11/13/ 202 1-IR-I\\n25\\nrefused to disclose any such information by claiming that it was personal in\\nnature and thus exempted under the provisions of section 8(1) (j) of the Right to\\nInformatinn (RTl) Act Not satisfied with this decision of the CPIO, the Appellant\\nhad preferred an appeal. The Appellate Authority had disposed of the appeal in\\na speaking order in which ho had endosod the decison o the CFhi\\'•.\\n4. We have carefully gone through the contents of the RTI application and\\nthe order of the Appellate Authority. We have also considered the submissions\\n-1\\nof both the respondent and the third party in the case. The entire information\\nsought by the Appellant revolves around the complaints made against an officer\\nof the government and any possible action the authorities might have taken on\\nthose complaints. The Appellate Authority was very right in deciding that this\\nentire class of information was qualified as personal informahon witIn the\\nmeaning of the provisions of Section 8 (i) (j) of the All Act. In this connection, it\\nis very pertinent to cite the decision of the Supreme Court of India in the\\'SLP(C)\\nNo. 27734 of 2012 (Girish P Deshpando vs dO and others) in which it has held\\nthat the performance of an employee/Officer in an organisation is primarily a\\nmatter between the employee and the employer and normally those aspects\\nare governed by tho service rules which fall under the expression personal\\ninformation, the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or\\npublic interest. On the other hand, the disclosure of which could cause\\nunwarranted invasion of the privacy of that individual.\" The Supreme Court\\nfurther hold that such information could be disclosed only if it would serve a\\nlarger public interestThe information sought by the Appellant in this case is\\nabout some complaints made against a government official and any possible\\naction the authorities might have taken on those complaints.

He apprehends, the\\ninterested parties would cause a threat to the activist and\\nin fact there had been past incidents of unnatural deaths\\nof activist in the field, presumably by the interested\\npersons having vested interest to conceal the information\\nthat is asked for by the activist.\\nThe petitioner submits, the authority may not\\ninsist upon the detailed address particularly when the\\napplicant would provide a particular post box number\\nthat would automatically conceal their identity to the\\npublic at large.\\nWe have considered the relevant provisions of\\nthe statute. Section 6(2) of the Right to Information Act,\\n2005 would clearly provide, an applicant making request\\nfor information shall not be required to give any reason\\nfor requesting the information or any other personal\\ndetails except those that may be necessary for\\ncontacting him.\\nLooking to the said provision, we find logic in\\nthe submission of the petitioner. When the legislature\\nthought it fit, the applicant need not disclose any\\npersonal detail, the authority should not insist upon his168/19 1\\n11/13/ 202 i-IR-\\n2522461/2023/IR-I\\n2\\ndetailed whereabouts particularly when post box number\\nis provided for that would establish contact with him and\\nthe authority.\\nIn case, the authority would find any difficulty\\nwith the post box number, they may insist upon personal\\ndetails. However, in such case, it would be the solemn\\nduty of the authority to hide such information and\\nparticularly from their website so that people at large\\nwould not know of the details.\\nWe thus dispose of this writ petition by making\\nthe observations as above. The Secretary, Ministry of\\nPersonnel should circulate the copy of this order to all\\nconcerned so that the authority can take appropriate\\nmeasure to hide information with regard to personal\\ndetails of the activist to avoid any harassment by the\\npersons having vested interest.\\nThe writ petition is disposed of without any\\norder as to costs.\\nUrgent certified copy of this order, if applied for,\\nbe given to the parties, on priority basis.\\n(Barterjee, Acting Chief Justice)\\n(Debangsu Basak, J.)169/191\\n11//i 3/2021-IR-I\\n2522461/2023/JR-I\\nF.No. 1/1/2013-JR\\nGovernment of India\\nMinistry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions\\nDepartment of Personnel and Training\\nNorth Block, New Delhi\\n7th\\nDated the October, 2016\\nOFFiCE MEMORANDUM\\nSubject- Uploading of RTI replies on the respective websites of\\nMinistries I Deparbnents\\nAttention is invited to para 1.41. of the enclosed guidelines referred to in\\nthis Deptt.\\'s O.M.

That Department has further opined that provision of Section 12(4) or\\nSection 15(4) of the RTI Act does not empower the Chief Information\\nCommissioner to constitute the Benches.\\n3. In view of this legal position, you are requested to advise the State\\nInformation Commission that decisions on the complaints and appeals should be\\ntaken by the State Information Commission as defined in Section 2(k) of the RTI\\nAct, 2005 and not by the Benches of the Commission.\\nYours faithfully,\\n(K.G.

Para 10 of Part I of the Guide, inter alia, stated that \\'only such\\ninformation can be supplied under the Act which already exists and is held by the\\npublic authority or held under the control of the public authority. The Public\\nInformation Officer is not supposed to create information; or to interpret\\ninformation; or to solve the problems raised by the applicants, or to furnish replies\\nto hypothetical questions.\\' The same issue has been elaborated by the Supreme\\nCourt in the matter of Central Board of Secondary Education & Anr. Vs. Aditya\\nBandopadhyay & Ors. (Civil Appeal No.6454 of 2011) as follows:\\n\"At this juncture, it is necessary to clear some misconceptions about the RTI\\nAct. The Rh Act provldes access to all information that is available and\\nexisting. This is clear from a combined reading of section 3 and the\\ndefinitions of \\'information\\' and \\'right to information\\' under clauses (f) and\\n(j) of section 2 of the Act. If a public authority has any information in the\\nform of data or analysed data, or abstracts, or statistics, an applicant may\\naccess such informatiofi, subject to the exemptions in Section 8 of the Act.\\nBut where the information sought is not a part of the record of a public\\nauthority, and where such information is not required to be maintained\\nunder any law or the rules or regulations of the public authority, the Act\\ndoes not cast an obligation upon the public authority, to collect or collate\\nsuch non available information and then furnish it to an applicant. A public\\nauthority is also not required to furnish information which require drawing\\nof inferences and/or making of assumptions. It is also not required to\\nprovide \\'advice\\' or \\'opinion\\' to an applicant, nor required to obtain and181/191\\n11/13/ 202 1-IR-I\\n2522461/2023/IR-I\\nfurnish any \\'opinion\\' or adiice\\' to an ipoiicant. The reference to \\'opinion\\'\\nor \\'advice\\' in the definition of \\'information\\' in section 2(f) of the Act, only\\nrefers to such material available in the records of the public a ithor.ity. Many\\npublic authorities have, as a public relation exercise, provide advice,\\nguidance and opinion to the citizens. But that is purely voluntary and should\\nnot be confused with any obligation under the RTI Act.\"\\n3. This may be brought to the notice of all concerned.\\n(K.G.

This access in the form of the right to\\ninformation is an essential aspect of a civil and democratic society. The existence of legislation\\naround freedom or right to information has a direct impact on the approach of government\\nfunctionariesand potentiallypreventsabuseof processesby the state.\\nFreedom of information, broadly articulated as right to information in India was enshrined in the\\nUniversal Declaration for Human Rights as far back as 1948 where it was included as one of the\\nfacets of freedom of expression. Subsequent international instruments also recognized this\\nparticular right. After years of movement seeking legislation on right to information, the Indian\\ngovernment enactedthe Right toInformation Actin 2005.\\nThe Right to Information Act was enacted with the objective of “settingoutthepractical regimeof right\\nto information for citizens to secure access to information under the control of public authorities,in ordertopromote\\ntransparencyand accountability in theworking ofeverypublicauthority.”\\nDespite the novel intentions of the legislature, the implementation of the acthasnot beensmooth\\nat all. The Public Information Officers (PIOs) and the Appellate Authorities (AAs) established\\nunder the act deny information arbitrarilywithout anylegalbasisunderthe RTIAct. Whilelawyers\\nmight somehow be able to crack the flawedreplieswithcomplex legalarguments,the taskisnot as\\neasy for people without a legal background. Therefore, it is necessary that legal information on\\ntacklingtheillegalitiesofthePIOsand theAAs isaccessedby awideraudience.\\nThe current toolkit was born out of the experience of amultitude ofpeople incivil societydealing\\nwith arbitrary and illegal actions of the PIOs and the AAs. The toolkit is simple and easy to\\nunderstand, and it is recommended that you read the section on how to use this toolkit to better\\nunderstand thecomplex legalargumentsthat goin dismantlingthe repliesofthe PIOs.\\n3|PageHow to usethisToolkit\\nThe current toolkit follows asimple formatofaproblem-solution approach.It ismade fromthe\\ncollectiveexperienceofabunch ofpeople who havebeenusingRTIs as amaintoolforresearch.\\n● Part I – It firstly delineates important definitions in the Act and their interpretations by\\nvarious courts.Itwillbe preferableif thereadergoes throughthem.\\n● Part II – After the definitions, it is necessary to go through the format of application and\\nappeal. Although there is no hard and fast rule as to how an application is to be filed, the\\nformatpresentssome criticalelementswhich mayhelpinappeal.\\n● Part III – We then deal with tackling the replies of the PIOsby covering responsesagainst\\nthe most common grounds of rejectionin our experience.We dealwiththe rejection ofthe\\nRTI application on the basis of the provisions of the RTI Act and arguments andcasesto\\ntackle them during appeal. Further, we have also dealt with judgments that are usually\\nmisinterpretedand used asthe basisof rejectionof applications.\\n● Part IV – In this part, we have coveredthe grounds ofrejection underrespective RTIstate\\nrules ofChhattisgarh, Gujaratand Jharkhandandour argumentsagainstthe same.\\n4|PageI. GeneralProvisions\\nA.

CPIO, Ministry of Human Resource and Development, 2018 SCC\\nOnLine CIC312\\n● Section 2(i)record\\nSection 2(i) record: \"record\" includes— (a) any document, manuscript and file; (b) any\\nmicrofilm, microfiche and facsimile copy of a document; (c) any reproduction of image or\\nimages embodied in such microfilm (whether enlarged or not); and (d) any other material\\nproducedby acomputeror anyother device;\\n● Section 2(j)“rightto information”\\nSection 2(j) “right to information”: \"right to information\" means the right to information\\naccessible under this Act which is held by or under the control of any public authority and\\nincludes the right to— (i) inspection of work, documents, records; (ii) taking notes, extracts or\\ncertified copies of documents or records; (iii) taking certified samples of material; (iv)obtaining\\ninformation in the form of diskettes, floppies, tapes, video cassettes or in any other electronic\\nmode or through printouts where such information is stored in a computer or in any other\\ndevice;\\nB. PROACTIVEDISCLOSUREUNDERSECTION4\\nSection 4 requires every public authority (definition of term ‘public authority’ is given under\\nSection 2(h)) toprovideall the informationthat ismentionedin Section 4(1)(b)tothe publicsuo\\nmoto (thatis, withoutanyrequestby any individual)through various meansofcommunication at\\nregularintervals.\\nSection 4(1)(b) of the RTI Act lists information that the public authorities have to publish by\\nthemselves. This list contains within its ambit a vast array of information. The use of the word\\n“shall” in the provision makes it mandatory and binding on the part ofthe publicauthoritiesto\\ndisclose this information on their website or make it easily accessible. This needs to be done in\\norder topromote transparencyand accountabilityin theworking ofevery publicauthorityandto\\ncontaincorruption.\\n5|PageThis is thegreatestweapon whilefilingan RTIapplicationandan appealaswell.

CASELAWONIMPORTANCEOFBEINGHEARDDURINGAPPEAL\\nWe further submit that taking a decision in the First Appeal without hearing the Applicant is a\\nviolation oftheprinciplesofnaturaljustice andthe spirit ofthe RTIAct.\\nIn the matter of Mr. R. K. Jain vs. Department of Legal Affairs Government of India (File\\nNo.CIC/SA/A/2014/000254) the Central Information Commission observed the following:\\n“Passing orders infirstappeal without hearingorsending hearingnotice isillegaland willrender theorderinvalid.\\nThe Commission has set aside the order of First Appellate Authorityforbreach ofnaturaljusticeby denyingthe\\nappellant a chance of presenting his case and by raising an entirely a new defence which was never claimed.

Fighting theIllegalities\\nThis part of the toolkit will go deeper into tackling the replies of the PIOs. Usually,ashasbeen\\nstated above, the replies of the PIO while rejecting the application are based on incorrect\\ninterpretation of law and cases decided by the CIC or the Supreme Court. This is also a scare\\ntactic utilized by them as language of the law can be daunting for people who are not\\naccustomedtoit.\\nSince most of the replies bythe PIOarebad inlaw, challengingthese repliesisnot verydifficult.\\nAppellants canrefertotheRTI Act,various judgments, thelacunae in thejudgments citedby the\\nPIO, the base documents of the relevant subject matter and draftacomprehensivereplyforthe\\nsame. The appeal application has to be stronginlawas the appellate authorities,likethe PIOs,are\\nlooking for any reason to reject your appeal. Usually, the only thing that causes fear in them is\\nthe languageofthe lawrealizing thattheycannot misinterpretlaw andrandomlyciteinapplicable\\nprovisions and cases because the appellant knows how to counter each and every argumentput\\nforth.\\nIn this part, we have tried to cover and tackleas manygrounds ofrejection as possible.Wehave\\nfurther divided this part into two sections. The first section deals with the rejection of the RTI\\napplication on the basis of the provisions of the RTI Act or respective RTI state rules, and\\narguments and cases to tackle them duringappeal.Thesecond sectiondealswithjudgments that\\nareusuallymisinterpretedand used asthe basisof rejectionof applications.\\nA.

SECTION8(1)(e)\\nSection 8(1)(e): Notwithstanding anything contained inthis Act,thereshall benoobligationto giveanycitizen\\ninformation available to a person in his fiduciary relationship, unless the competent authorityis satisfiedthatthe\\nlargerpublicinterestwarrantsthe disclosureofsuchinformation.\\nThis provisionprovides forexemption ofinformation frombeingdisclosed asthe information is\\navailable to a person in his fiduciary relationship. In such cases, information can be disclosed\\nonly if the authority is satisfied that the larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such\\ninformation. The information is usually rejected on the groundsthat the informationsought for\\nby theapplicant isavailableto theconcerned authorityin fiduciaryrelationship.\\nArgument againstthereply ofthePIO\\n1) If the PIO has denied access to information by stating that the information is held in\\nfiduciary relationship, then showing what constitutes a fiduciary relationship can be an\\neffectivecounter argument (wespecificallyappliedthis inthe EPFORTIs)\\nIn decisions such as Mr. K K Bora vs Employees Provident Fund (Decision No.\\nCIC/SG/A/2010/002600/12400), it has been clarified and upheld that for information to be\\nexempted under S. 8(1)(e) “….it is necessary that the third party should have some choice in\\nsupplying the information and should have provided it withtheconditionof confidentiality.” As\\nwas further held in the case, the information held by EPFO is in discharge of a statutory\\nrequirement.\\n“An equally important characteristic for the relationshipto qualifyasafiduciary relationship isthatthe\\nprovider of information gives the information for using it for the benefit of the one who is providing the\\ninformation. All relationships usually have an element of trust, but all of them cannot be classified as\\nfiduciary. Information provided in discharge of a statutory requirement, or to obtain a job, or to get a\\nlicense,cannot beconsidered tohave beengiven inafiduciaryrelationship.”\\nIn a recent 2018 decision in the case Nagraj Janardhan Patil v. PIO, EPFO, Nasik\\n(CIC/EPFOG/A/2016/294053 - 20 February 2018), the Commission went onto impose\\npenalty on the PIO as the denial of EPFO information on the grounds of it being “personal\\ninformation’’ and “third party information’’ is “illegal and illogical”. While PIO argued that the\\ninformation is personal and hence exempted, the CIC Acharyulu observed that Public\\nProvident Fund is public informationand should begiven underRTI.\\n12|PageFurther, in another recent judgment in 2017 titled Shankar Singh v. PIO, EPFO, Jabalpur\\n(CIC/EPFOG/A/2017/314655), the phrase “fiduciary relationship”wasanalysed ingreatdetail\\nby the Hon’ble Commission and finally itconcludedthat presenceof astatutorydutyto provide\\ninformation that has to bedistinguished fromthefiduciary relation.TheOrder citedthe Gujarat\\nHigh Court judgment in Rajendra Vasantlal Shah vs. Central Information Commissioner\\nand Ors (AIR 2011 Guj 70) which hadheld that anystatutorybody serving publicgoodcannot\\nclaimtobeworking inafiduciary capacity.\\n2) Generalargument inall situations\\nThe strongest argument against rejection under this provision can be made by citing section\\n4(1)(b) which is proactive disclosure. If the information sought comes under any of the clauses\\nmentionedinthe section,the argumentof fiduciaryrelationship cannotstand.\\nFor example, if information regarding budget disclosure of a particular department is rejected\\nwith the reason that it is against public interest, the applicant can sight section4(1)(b)(xi) which\\nstates that, the authority is bound to publish “the budget allocated to each of its agency, indicating the\\nparticulars ofallplans,proposed expendituresand reportsondisbursements made”.\\nRakesh Kumar Singh and others versus Harish Chander, Assistant Director and others Central\\nInformationCommission(CIC/WB/A/2006/00469)held that-\\n“The word fiduciary is derived from the Latin fiducia meaning “trust, a person (including a juristic\\nperson such as Government, University or bank) who has the power and obligation to act for another\\nunder circumstances which require total trust, goodfaith and honesty.The mostcommonexample ofsuch\\na relationship is the trustee of a trust, but fiduciaries caninclude business advisers,attorneys,guardians,\\nadministrators, directorsofacompany,publicservants inrelationtoagovernmentand seniormanagers of\\na firm/company etc. The fiduciary relationship can also be oneof moralorpersonalresponsibility dueto\\nthe superior knowledge and training of the fiduciary as comparedto theonewhose affairsthefiduciary is\\nhandling. In short, it is a relationship wherein one personplaces completeconfidenceinanotherinregard\\nto aparticular transactionor one’sgeneralaffairsof business.”\\nIt is only if the relationship is of the nature as described above can the information bedeclined\\nunder section 8(1(e). If the relationship does not fulfil the above criteria, then section 8(1)(e)\\ncannot beinvoked.\\nIn the case of Reserve Bank of India vs. Jayantilal N. Mistry (Civil Appeal No. 91 of 2015), the\\nCIC heldthat,\\n“The exemption contained in Section 8(1)(e) applies to exceptional cases and only withregard tocertain\\npieces of information, for which disclosure is unwarrantedorundesirable.If informationisavailablewith\\na regulatory agency not infiduciary relationship,thereis noreasontowithholdthedisclosure ofthesame.\\nHowever, where information is required by mandate of law to be provided to an authority, it cannot be\\nsaidthat suchinformationisbeing providedinafiduciary relationship.”\\n4. SECTION8(1)(h)\\nSection 8(1)(h) (h): information which would impede the processofinvestigation orapprehensionorprosecutionof\\noffenders\\nArgument againstthereply ofthePIO\\n13|PageIn the case Jiwan Garg vs. PIO, Director General of Police, Punjab, it was held that a vague or\\ngeneral pleathat disclosure wouldimpede the prosecutionwould not besufficient.\\n“Whether in a particular case disclosure of daily diary would impede investigation or prosecution of\\noffenders is a matter of fact, to be judged on merits of each case. No generalizedprecedent applicable to\\nallrequestsforinformationcan belaid. Eachcaseis tobejudgedonits factsand merits.\\nSection 8(1) (h)does notgrantan automaticexemption fromdisclosure ofinformationineachcasewhich\\nisatany stage ofinvestigation orapprehensionorprosecutionofoffenders.\\n.\\n.\\nThe respondent cannot presume an automatic connectionbetween disclosureand impeding ofinvestigation\\nor prosecution etc of offenders. The respondent must show, at least prima facie, how disclosure of daily\\ndiary in factwould resultin thisconsequence. Thecauseand affectneedto beshownby respondent.\\nDelhi High Court in W (PC) No. 3144 of 2007, while considering the import of Clause 8 (1) (h) of\\nthe RTI Act held that, “It is apparent that the mere existence of an investigation process cannot be a\\nground for refusal of the information; the authority withholding information must show satisfactory\\nreasons as to why the release of such information would hamper the investigation process. Such reasons\\nshould be germane, and the opinion of the process being hampered should be reasonable and based on\\nsome material. Sans this consideration, Section 8 (1) (h) and other such provisions would become the\\nhavenfordodging demandforinformation.”\\n5. SECTION8(1)(j)\\nSection 8(1)(j): Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give anycitizen,\\ninformation which relates to personal information thedisclosureof whichhas norelationship toanypublicactivity\\nor interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unlessthe Central Public\\nInformation Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is\\nsatisfied thatthelargerpublicinterestjustifies the disclosureofsuchinformation:\\nProvided that the information which cannot be deniedtothe ParliamentoraState Legislatureshallnotbedenied\\ntoany person.\\nUsually, this section is cited when information regarding a third party is sought. Bear in mind\\nthat this section only emphasizes that “personal information” having norelationship withapublicactivity\\ncannot besought.\\nArgument againstthereply ofthePIO\\n1) Thetestunderthisprovision\\nApplications seeking ‘personal information’ cannot be rejected outrightly. For the exemption in\\nsection 8(1)(j)toapply,three conditions mustbe met:\\n1. Theinformationmustbe personal third-partyinformation\\n2. Itmust havenorelationship toany publicactivityorinterest,and\\n14|Page3. Disclosure of the information must cause an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of a\\nthirdparty.\\nThe appellant can then explain the current fact scenario and how the information sought does\\nnot fulfiltheingredients ofthis section.\\nFurthermore, according to section 11, if the partof the informationdoesinvolvesomepersonal\\ninformation which might violate privacy of an individual, the same canbe severedundersection\\n10ofthe Act,and theresthas tobe provided.\\nCasesto be cited:Facts andApplicability\\nConditions as laid out in Union Public Service Commission v R.K. Jain (decided on 6\\nNovember,2012)\\n“(i) The information sought must relate to \"Personal Information\". Therefore, iftheinformationsought does not\\nqualify as personalinformation,the exemptionwould notapply;\\n(ii) Such personal information should relate to a third person, i.e., a person other than theinformationseeker or\\nthepublicauthority;AND\\n(iii) (a) The information sought should not have a relation to any public activity qua such third person, or to\\npublic interest. If the information sought relates to public activity of the third party, i.e., to his activities falling\\nwithin thepublicdomain, theexemption wouldnotapply.Similarly,if thedisclosureof thepersonalinformationis\\nfound justified in public interest, the exemption would be lifted, otherwise not; OR (b) The disclosure of the\\ninformation would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual, and thatthereis nolargerpublic\\ninterestinvolvedinsuchdisclosure.”\\nConditions as laid out in Mr. Sujit Kumar Mazumder Advocate vs CBI (2011)\\n(CIC/SM/A/2011/000318/SG/13429)\\n1. It must be personal information: Words in a law should normally be given the meaning given in common\\nlanguage. In common language, we would ascribe the adjective \\'personal\\' to an attribute which applies to an\\nindividual and not to an institution or a Corporate. Therefore, it flows that \\'personal\\' cannot be related to\\ninstitutions, organizations or corporates. Hence Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act cannot be applied when the\\ninformationconcernsinstitutions, organizationsorcorporates.\\n2. The phrase\\'disclosureof whichhas norelationshipto anypublicactivityorinterest\\' meansthatthe information\\nmust have been given in the course of a public activity. Various public authorities in performing their functions\\nroutinely ask for \\'personal\\' information from citizens, and this is clearly a public activity. Public activitieswould\\ntypically include situations wherein a person applies for a job, or gives information about himself to a public\\nauthorityas anemployee,orasks forapermission, licenseorauthorization, orprovidesinformationindischarge of\\nastatutory obligation.\\n3. The disclosure of the information would lead to unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual. The\\nState has no right to invadethe privacyof anindividual. Thereare someextraordinary situations wherethe State\\nmay be allowed toinvadetheprivacy ofacitizen. Inthosecircumstances specialprovisions ofthe lawapplyusually\\nwith certain safeguards. Therefore, where theStateroutinely obtainsinformationfrom citizens,this informationis\\n15|Pageinrelationto apublicactivityandwill notbean intrusiononprivacy.\\n2) Public bodies such as EPFO cannot claim this exemption (wespecifically appliedthisin\\nthe EPFORTIs)\\nIn the case of Nagraj Janardhan Patil v. PIO,EPFO,Nasik (CIC/EPFOG/A/2016/294053-20\\nFebruary 2018), the Commission went onto impose penalty on the PIO as the denial of EPFO\\ninformation on the grounds of it being “personal information’’ and “third partyinformation’’ is\\n“illegal and illogical”. While PIO argued that the information is personal and hence exempted,\\nthe CIC Acharyulu observed that “Public Provident Fund ispublic informationand should\\nbe givenunder RTI,toanyone whoseeks it,even if itisofanother person”.\\nFurther, in Shankar Singh v. PIO, EPFO, Jabalpur (CIC/EPFOG/A/2017/314655), the\\nCentral Information Commissioner Prof. M. Sridhar Acharyuluha further ordered that\\ninformation regarding the Provident Fund is “neither third party information nor anybody’s\\npersonal information.Itdoesnot warrantinvocation ofsection8(1)(j) ofRTIAct.”\\n6. SECTION11:THIRDPARTYINFORMATION\\nUsually, this section is cited by the PIO whentheinformation soughtisabout athirdparty. This\\nentire process of serving notice to the third personisrarelyfollowed. Despitethe sectionclearly\\nstipulating the procedure, the PIOs tend to outrightly rejected the application under section 11\\nreadwithsection 8(1)(j)\\nArgument againstthereply ofthePIO\\nIn such cases, PIO is required to follow the procedure laid down in Section 11 of the RTI Act\\n(that is, give the third-party time and opportunity to raise objections if he/she has any and\\nconsider the same before taking any decision). The final decision with regards to disclosure lies\\nwiththe PublicInformationOfficerandnot the thirdparty.\\nIt has been provided that except in the case of trade or commercial secrets protected by law,\\ndisclosure has to be allowed if the public interest in disclosure outweighs any possible harm or\\ninjury to the interests of a third party. If thethird party isaggrievedbythe decisionarrived atby\\nthe PIO,itcanpreferan appeal againstthe decisionunderSection 19.\\nFurthermore, it can also be shown that the information relates to a larger public interest and\\nhence,itisneededtobedisclosed.\\nCasesto be cited\\nMrs.AnitaSinghVs.Ministry ofExternal Affairs(2012) (CIC/SG/A/2012/000879/18681):\\n“Section 11 does not give a third party an unrestrained veto to refuse disclosing information. It clearly\\nanticipates situations where the PIO will notagreewiththe claimfornon-disclosureby athirdparty and\\nprovides for an appeal to be made by the third party against disclosure, which would have been\\nunnecessary, if the third party had been given a veto against disclosure. Thus, the PIO is expected to\\nfollow the procedure of Section 11, when he intends to disclose the information but has some reason to\\nbelieve that the third party treats it as confidential. If the third party sendsan objection,the PIOhasto\\ndetermine whethertheinformation isexempt underthe provisions oftheAct.”\\n16|PageMahesh Kumar Sharma, Vs. PIO, Delhi Jal Board, Govt. of NCT of Delhi (2009) (CIC\\n/AT/A/2008/01262//SG/adj):\\n“If the third-party objects to giving the information, the Public Information Officer must take his\\nobjections and see if any of the exemption clauses of Section 8 (1) apply. Ifanyof theexemption clauses\\napply, the PIO is then obliged to see if there is a larger public interest in disclosure. If none of the\\nexemption clausesapply,informationhas tobegiven.”\\nB. WHENPIOREJECTSINFORMATIONTHROUGHFLAWEDINTERPRETATIONOFLANDMARK\\nJUDGMENTS\\nIn this part, we will now discuss the counter to a few specific cases that the PIOs often use to\\nrejectinformation.\\n1.

Furthermore, section 7(9) clearly stipulates that the information shall\\nordinarily be provided in the form in which it is with the authority if the authority finds it is\\ndifficultorimpossibletocollect orcollatedata inthe formatthat ithasbeensought in.\\nFor example, in one particular case, Public Information Officer of a District Legal Services\\nAuthority cited this judgment to deny information that it was required to maintain as per\\n‘National Legal Services Authority’s Standard Operating Procedure for Under Trial Review\\nCommittees’(findappealpetitionattached here)\\n2.

Ifan application\\nwishes toseekinformationonmorethanonesubject matter,he shallmake separateapplications.\\nProvided that in case, the request made relates to more than one subject matter, the Public Information Officer\\nmay respond to the request relating to the firstsubject matteronly and mayadvisethe applicant tomakeseparate\\napplication foreachof theother subject matters.\\nThis reason is used most often by PIOs to reject the information when multiple information is\\nsoughteveniftheyareregardingone subject matter.\\nNowhere is it mentioned in Section 6 which deals with ‘Request for obtaininginformation’that\\nthe application needs to be restricted to one subject matter and Section 7(1) of the Act clearly\\nstates that requests for information can only be rejected for any of the reasons specified in\\nsections8and 9.\\nIt is further stated that the provision stating information sought has to be regarding only one\\nsubject matter, does not mean one query is equal to one subjectandmultiple information\\nregarding thesamesubject mattercanbe asked.\\nThe provision states that questions regarding only one subject matter can be asked, and the\\napplicant has made sure that the information is only regarding one subject matter. Again, the\\nPIO did not take into consideration the fact that “multiple information can be asked\\nregarding one subjectmattersolongas theapplication isordinarily under150 words.”\\nIn Sh. Ram Prakash Choudhary v. Public Information Officer Ministry of Health & Family\\nWelfareHealth Department (CIC/SG/A/2011/002312/15906),theCIC stated that,\\n“From a plain reading of Sections 6(1) and 7(1) of the RTI Act, there does not appear to be any\\nembargo on the scope of such request or application. In other words, there is no legal requirement onan\\napplicant’spartto restrictthe scopeofher RTIapplicationto onlyone subjectmatter.\\nWhat constitutes a ‘single subject matter’ has neither been defined in the RTI Act, the rules and\\nregulations framed thereunder. Intheabsenceof anymeansto determinewhattantamounts to‘one subject\\nmatter’, the PIO can, athis discretion,furnishpartinformationclaimingthat theremaininginformation\\nsought in the RTI application pertains to adifferentsubject matterforwhichaseparate RTI application\\nis required to be filed. The exercise of such discretion by the PIO is likely to be subjective resulting in\\narbitrary curtailment of the fundamental right to information of citizens and unnecessary expenditureof\\nmoney. In the absence of any clear definition of what‘onecategory ofrequest’ meansitwouldonly leadto\\narbitrary refusals of information under the RTI Act, leading to cloggingof theappellate mechanisms.In\\nviewof theabove,thecontention oftheRespondents is rejected.”\\n21|Pagec) Totalwords intheapplication shouldnot exceed150words\\nUnder the Chhattisgarh state and Court RTI rules, request for information should not be more\\nthan 150 words. There is no way to escape this rule other than to actually count the numberof\\nwords.\\n2. GUJARAT\\nd) Amreli – They ask for identification proof even though it isprohibitedunderthe parent\\nAct.\\n3. JHARKHAND\\ne) Rule 9 of Jharkhand High Court RTIrulesstate that –informationneeds tobe provided\\nto an applicant only if it is“requestedforwithapositive assertionthatthe motiveforobtainingsuch\\ninformationisproper andlegal”.\\n22|Page'}]\n"
